- The dataset I am exploring is focused on predicting the survival state of patients with liver cirrhosis, a serious condition resulting from prolonged liver damage, often attributed to factors such as hepatitis and chronic alcohol consumption. The data has been sourced from a comprehensive study conducted by the Mayo Clinic between 1974 and 1984, specifically examining primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver. This dataset contains vital information on 17 clinical features that play a pivotal role in forecasting the survival outcomes of patients. The survival states are categorized into 0 (D for death), 1 (C for censored), and 2 (CL for censored due to liver transplantation).The Mayo Clinic funded the creation of this dataset, making it a valuable resource for medical research and predictive modeling. It encompasses data related to individuals, with certain sensitive attributes like gender and age included. To ensure data quality, some preprocessing steps were undertaken, including removing rows with missing values in the Drug column, imputing missing values with mean results, and applying one-hot encoding for categorical attributes. This dataset presents an opportunity for in-depth analysis and predictive modeling to enhance our understanding of cirrhosis patient survival.

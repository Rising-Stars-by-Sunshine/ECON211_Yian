XAI Framework for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Classification Techniques,"Machine intelligence models are robust in classifying the datasets for data analytics and for predicting the insights that would assist in making clinical decisions. The models would assist in the disease prognosis and preliminary disease investigation, which is crucial for effective treatment. There is a massive demand for the interpretability and explainability of decision models in the present day. The models¡¯ trustworthiness can be attained through deploying the ensemble classification models in the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework. In the current study, the role of ensemble classifiers over the XAI framework for predicting heart disease from the cardiovascular datasets is carried out. There are 303 instances and 14 attributes in the cardiovascular dataset taken for the proposed work. The attribute characteristics in the dataset are categorical, integer, and real type and the associated task related to the dataset is classification. The classification techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM), AdaBoost, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), bagging, logistic regression (LR), and naive Bayes, are considered for classification purposes. The experimental outcome of each of those algorithms is compared to each other and with the conventional way of implementing the classification models. The efficiency of the XAI-based classification models is reasonably fair, compared to the other state-of-the-art models, which are assessed using the various evaluation metrics, such as area under curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), sensitivity, specificity, and the F1-score. The performances of the XAI-driven SVM, LR, and naive Bayes are robust, with an accuracy of 89%, which is assumed to be reasonably fair, compared to the existing models."
Cirrhosis,"Cirrhosis is a chronic condition that develops over many years and results in a myriad of physical examination findings. Many signs and symptoms associated with liver disease are nonspecific, but some findings, such as dilated abdominal veins, ascites, encephalopathy, abnormal hair distribution, and gynecomastia, are more specific and suggest underlying cirrhosis. Early identification of physical findings that suggest cirrhosis can guide the clinician to order testing aimed at determining the underlying cause of cirrhosis, provide lifestyle counseling to avoid progression of disease, and suggest appropriate treatment and screening recommendations."

# Code
- I start my data query process on Kaggle.com by first identifying the specific keywords or phrases related to the dataset I need. I enter these keywords in the search bar on Kaggle's homepage. As I hit the search button, Kaggle returns a list of datasets matching my query. I carefully review the search results, looking at the dataset names, descriptions, and metadata to ensure they align with my research objectives. Once I find a dataset that seems relevant, I click on it to get more information. I examine the dataset's structure, size, and any associated notebooks or discussions to gauge its quality and suitability for my project. If it meets my criteria, I proceed to download the dataset for further analysis. This methodical process ensures I find the most appropriate data for my specific needs on Kaggle.
